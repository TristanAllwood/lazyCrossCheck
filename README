LazyCrossCheck
--------------

A small, work in progress cross-checking library, for use in programming
exercises to check student solutions against a model answer.

Based on the ideas drawn out of Irulan[1], which was inspired by
SmallCheck/LazySmallCheck[2].

Have a look at Tester.hs for an example of usage.  Sample output:

>runghc Tester.hs

version (Just undefined): student's answer is more general.
  student answer = 2
  model answers:
   version (Just 1) = 1
   version (Just 2) = 2
   version (Just 3) = 3
